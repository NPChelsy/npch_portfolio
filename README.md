## Experience

**Research Assistant (Remote) | Department of Linguistics, SFU | Burnaby, BC | Jan 2024 - Aug 2025**

- Utilized Python libraries, data processing methods, and data scraping tools to process a Hindi Treebank, and successfully extracted 6000+ entries and 19 linguistic features, suitable for ML tasks. 

- Maintained frequent communication and collaborative work with the professor and Hindi native speakers through biweekly meetings on Zoom and Teams to refine the dataset and improve ML models. 

- Researched and implemented 4 classifiers and 2 neural network models to predict grammatical gender with linguistic features, successfully discovered how inflection boosts prediction accuracy.


**Research Volunteer (Remote) | Department of Linguistics, SFU | Burnaby, BC | Jan 2025 - Apr 2025**

- Developed and improved 3 Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with PyTorch Geometric to classify protein networks, achieving over 95% accuracy on real and synthetic protein clouds. 

- Applied Explainer AI methods with PyTorch’s GNNExplainer, and used visualization in Python to highlight GNNExplainer’s result on 3D graphs. 


**Literacy Tutor | Friends of Simon Tutoring Program | Burnaby, BC | Jan 2023 - Jun 2025**

- Provided academic and social support to 200+ newcomer K-12 students across 7 schools in Lower Mainland Vancouver through weekly educational activities. 
- Collaborated with tutors and educators to host field trips to SFU Burnaby campus, allowing 2oo+ students to engage in fun, enriching workshops and team-building activities.
